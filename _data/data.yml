career-profile:
    title: Introduction
    summary: |
      Hello and welcome to my CV! I finished my bachelor's degree in Media Computer Science in late 2017. After that, I decided to pursue my passion for games and studied Games at the HAW Hamburg. Currently I am developing the Videogame [Wild Woods](http://www.wildwoodsgame.com/) at Octofox Games, a small Indie Studio that I founded together with 3 fellow students in 2022.

experiences:
      - role: Game Dev and Partner
        time: 2022 - present
        company: Octofox Games
        details: After securing funding for Wild Woods we founded the Indie Studio Octofox Games. During my time at Octofox Games, I was responsible for various areas. My work on the game primarily involved network programming, world generation, AI and gameplay programming. Additionally, I created various tools to simplify the work of level and game designers. Beyond game development, I contributed to game design, project management and coordination, created various complex spreadsheets, and played a pivotal role in publisher negotiations.

      - role: Game Dev
        time: 2020 - 2022
        company: self-employed
        details: While continuing work on Wild Woods I worked on the serious game [EDDi - Epidemic Disease Detectives Hamburg](https://www.hoou.de/projects/eddi-epidemic-disease-detectives-hamburg/preview). Eddi is a serious game that provides a playful learning opportunity to learn infection epidemiological knowledge. I was responsible for programming and the game Design.

       I analyzed to what extent different, Monte-Carlo-based learning algorithms are capable of solving the nondeterministic game 2048. I came to the conclusion, that mediocre results can be reached quickly, but Monte-Carlo-based algorithms can't compete with modern, state of the art, agents.
